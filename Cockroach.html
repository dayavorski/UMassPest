            <p> The cockroach is an brown oval-shaped insect about an inch-and-a-half long, with a yellow band around its head.
                They tend to hide during the day and come out at night.
            </p>

            <p> To eliminate cockroaches, lightly scatter boric acid powder (non-toxic to humans) in cracks and crevices within your living space.
                The powder is then ingested by the creatures, triggering dehydration and death.
              Another option is using bait stations. Once the roaches consume the bait, they will bring the poison back to their nests,
            killing both them and others in the colony. </p>
