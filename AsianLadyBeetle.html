            <p> Asian Lady Beetles are very similar in appearance to ladybugs, with a couple key differences. Asian lady beetles can
                range in color, while ladybugs are almost exclusively solid red. Asian Lady Beetles tend to have more spots, potentially
                as many as 19!
