        The dorms (and many academic buildings) of UMass Amherst often become plagued by pests, 
        particularly during the fall and winter seasons. If you're confused about what you're up against, or need help removing
        these critters, you've come to the right place! The most common invaders of UMass, namely cockroaches, stinkbugs, Asian lady beetles,
        and fruit flies, each have their own dedicated page in the navigator above.
