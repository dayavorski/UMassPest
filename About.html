            <p> My first semester as a transfer student, I was placed in McNamara. Within the very first week,
                my suitemates and I were greeted by several cockroaches, some alive, some dead. After a visit from pest control to no avail,
            my roommate and I did our own research to get rid of the little buggers for good. That experience inspired me to create this website,
        where I could provide helpful information so you can be your own exterminator in lieu of the university. </p>
